# Retrieving Vechicles Through Natural Language Queries

Retrieving vehicles through natural language queries involves the development of sophisticated systems that can understand and process human language requests for information about vehicles. The use of natural language queries provides users with a more intuitive and convenient way to search for information about vehicles, as they can express their queries in a more conversational way. Deep learning techniques have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of systems for retrieving vehicles through natural language queries, making them an important area of research and development in this field.

# Dataset

Dataset used for the current project is CityFLow-NL[10] taken from AICity competition 2023. Track 2 is dedicated for retrieving vechicles by Natural Language Descriptions.
Dataset comprises over 5,000 distinct and precisely NL descriptions of vehicle targets, which makes it the first multi-target multi-camera tracking dataset to our knowledge.
